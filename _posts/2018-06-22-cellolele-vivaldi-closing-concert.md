Caffè Vivaldi has been my musical home since I came to NYC 3 years ago. It was the first place I performed in the city, 
and I've met some of the most talented, genuine people of my life through it. 

It shut down permanently last week, but we managed to get a video of our last two songs there. Skip ahead to 2:00 for the 
beginning of the song, or watch the whole thing if you're feeling like the full experience.
