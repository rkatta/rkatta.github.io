I am in my late twenties and I have started to read Harry Potter again. I have read the first two books maybe 4 or 5 times. 
I like to read the HP series when I've been away from reading for a while and I want
to start again. This time I started with the third book and I read it in three days.
And now that I've gotten into the 'flow' of reading, I'll be picking something else up. 
HP is my gateway book :D
