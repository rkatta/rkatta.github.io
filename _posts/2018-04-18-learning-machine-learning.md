Machine learning. Just when you thought there were enough blog posts about the best way to learn, here's another.

Jokes aside, there are so many online resources now for getting started with machine learning that the biggest problem
is figuring out which ones are right for you. These are the resources that worked for me:

1. [Andrew Ng's first Coursera course][coursera]. I started learning machine learning with this course. It's a great 
primer, based on the real CS229 course at Stanford and I'd recommend it to anyone starting off from a math/CS background.
2. [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow][book]. After I finished the Coursera course, I wanted
to start applying ML hands on. This book is the most modern one I could find, and so far it's been great.
3. [Andrew Ng's deep learning specialization][deep-learning]. I'm gradually working through the 5 course deep learning 
specialization on my free time.
